A side meeting of IETF 120
 
                                        Telecom Cloud Services and Operations

Background:
In the rapidly evolving world of cloud computing, network operators have deployed their own clouds, known as Telecom Clouds, to deliver optimized services by integrating their networks with cloud infrastructure.
Elasticity is a key characteristic of cloud services, allowing for rapid deployment and flexible resource adjustment. However, most networks are relatively rigid and cannot fully meet these needs. To address new service requirements, Telecom Cloud has evolved towards multi-cloud and edge clouds, introducing new demands for provisioning and operation.
Moreover, TSPs use equipment from multiple vendors, making interoperability essential. Unlike public clouds, which can rely on a single vendor, Telecom Cloud Services require seamless interoperability across diverse systems and hardware. This presents both challenges and opportunities for collaboration, particularly within the IETF.
